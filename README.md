### Abstract

This project presents a configurable multi-channel Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) system designed for precise LED brightness control. The system allows users to adjust the brightness of multiple LEDs independently by varying duty cycles across several PWM channels. A flexible interface enables easy reconfiguration of parameters such as frequency, duty cycle, and channel count, making the design adaptable to various lighting applications. Emphasis is placed on achieving smooth brightness transitions and minimizing flicker through optimized PWM signal generation. The project explores both hardware-based and software-based PWM approaches, balancing performance with resource efficiency. Overall, this configurable PWM solution offers a scalable, customizable method for efficient LED brightness management in diverse environments.
